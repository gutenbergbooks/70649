5. While the undersigned will not hold themselves responsible for the
correctness of the description, genuineness, or authenticity of, or any
fault or defect in, any Lot, and make no Warranty whatever, they will,
upon receiving previous to date of Sale trustworthy expert opinion
in writing that any Painting or other Work of Art is not what it is
represented to be, use every effort on their part to furnish proof to
the contrary; failing in which, the object or objects in question will
be sold subject to the declaration of the aforesaid expert, he being
liable to the Owner or Owners thereof, for damage or injury occasioned
thereby.

during the Sale._

7. _Upon failure to comply with the above conditions, the money
deposited in part payment shall be forfeited; all Lots uncleared within
one day from conclusion of Sale shall be re-sold by public or private
sale, without further notice, and the deficiency (if any) attending

_EARLY EVENING_

Water Color

_Height, 15½ inches; width, 11½ inches_


A low cottage, near which stand two leafless trees, their straggling
branches extending out of the picture, is the prominent object in the
composition, and is silhouetted against a quiet sky. In the foreground
on the left are small wooden coops and the roof of an outbuilding, and
on the right is a path bordered by a row of a small bushes. The glow of
lamplight in the cottage window, which is partly screened by an opaque
curtain, indicates that twilight is near.

DUTCH: 1854-

_THE COBBLER_

Water Color

_Height, 18 inches; width, 13 inches_


An old Dutch cobbler, pipe in mouth, sits in a low chair near a window
under which is his cobbler’s bench with various tools, engaged in
repairing a shoe which he holds on the leather apron on his lap. The
figure is lighted by a narrow window, the casements of which are thrown
open, and a petroleum lamp with a tin shade hangs from a beam over the
cobbler’s head.

DUTCH: 1854-

_WINTER IN BREUKELEN--HOLLAND_

Water Color

_Height, 11 inches; length, 17½ inches_


A heavy fall of snow is on the ground and the winding hedge-bordered
village street, which leads from the foreground around to the right
between low cottages, is broken by the single track of a cart which is
seen proceeding along toward the houses. On the left a row of pollarded
trees grows along what is apparently a canal, now covered with ice,
and on the opposite bank stands a farm building and a row of trees in
winter foliage.

  _Signed at the lower left_, N. BASTERT.

Johannes Bosboom

DUTCH: 1817-1891

_CASTLE BY THE SEA_

Water Color

_Height, 11 inches; width, 8½ inches_


In a broad, open street or market-place in a small fishing village in
Holland stands a lofty stone building with a corner tower, evidently
the relics of bygone grandeur. Alongside, and contrasting strongly
with it, is a low cottage with red-tiled roof, and beyond it are other
cottages at the foot of a dune, over the crest of which is seen the
mast of a fishing vessel. A few figures are grouped in the shade of the
tower and a woman is walking toward the foreground in the sunlight.

  _Signed at the lower left_, BOSBOOM, ’61.

Margaretha Vogel Roosenboom

DUTCH: 1843-1898

_PEONIES_

Water Color

_Height, 12 inches; length, 20 inches_


Two large white peonies in full blossom, and others in bud, have been
carelessly thrown upon a stone bench in strong light from the upper
left. The background is a broken tone of gray.

  _Signed at the lower right_, MARGT. ROOSENBOOM.

DUTCH: 1843-1898

_PEONIES_

Water Color

_Height, 27½ inches; width, 19½ inches_


A great bunch of pink and yellow peonies, some in full blossom, some
in bud, are arranged with their leaves in a low glass jar on a stone
bench and are strongly lighted from the upper left. The background is a
broken tone of gray.

  _Signed at the lower right_,
  MARGT. VOGEL ROOSENBOOM.

Johannes Martinus Vrolyk

DUTCH: 1846-1896

_A PASTURE IN HOLLAND_

Water Color

_Height, 21 inches; length, 30 inches_


In the foreground a brown and white cow is browsing on the rough
herbage of a broad pasture, and near her stands a peasant in a blue
blouse. The pasture is bounded on the right by an irregular hedge
of small trees, and on the left, in the middle distance, are seen
approaching a cow and calf, and several other cattle. The view extends
across the broad, irregular pasture to a distant horizon, softened by
the delicate mist of summer. The sky is nearly covered by luminous
clouds, and a few birds flutter above the trees.

  _Signed at the lower right_, JAN VROLYK.




Nº 8

Johannes Bosboom

DUTCH: 1817-1891

_THE VILLAGE CANAL_

Water Color

_Height, 9 inches; length, 13 inches_


A quiet waterway, extending from the left foreground diagonally to
the right, is bordered on either side by broad, level quays. On the
left, lofty buildings with red-tiled roofs rise against the sky, and
on either side of the canal grow great rank trees in full foliage, and
through an opening between them is a glimpse of a sunlit building.
The figures of women, in characteristic white caps, are seen here and
there, one of them engaged in washing clothes on the far side of the
canal.

  _Signed at the lower right_, J. BOSBOOM.




Nº 9

Henri Harpignies

FRENCH: 1819-

_FRENCH LANDSCAPE_

Water Color

_Height, 8½ inches; length, 12 inches_


This is a view across an open valley, broken by a roadway and irregular
pools of water, to distant tree-covered slopes. On the left, irregular
masses of foliage are in strong silhouette against a luminous sky, and
on the right rounded trees crown the steep declivity of a low hill.
Near the foreground a few slender poplars grow on a low bank between a
sandy road and a pool of water which reflects the light of the sky at
the zenith.

  _Signed at the lower left_, =h’h=ARPIGNIES, ’92.

Anton Mauve

DUTCH: 1838-1888

_THE PEASANT’S HOME_

Water Color

_Height, 12 inches; width, 8½ inches_


An old Dutch peasant in rough garments, wooden shoes and with an apron
tied around his waist, is engaged in sweeping the ground with a rough
besom, near the corner of an old board hovel. A barrel partly filled
with sticks stands near him, and beyond is suggested a grassy field
bounded in the distance by a grove of slender trees.

  _Signed at the lower right_, A. MAUVE.




Nº 11

Josef Israëls

DUTCH: 1824-

_A PENSIVE SEWER_

Water Color

_Height, 13 inches; width, 8 inches_


A young Dutch peasant woman is seated in a low kitchen chair near a
latticed window, engaged in sewing upon a white garment, and while
intent upon her work, her thoughts are evidently far away. She wears
a white cap, a pink jacket and a black petticoat, and the figure is
strongly lighted from the window on the left.

  _Signed at the lower left_, JOSEF ISRAËLS.




Nº 12

George Poggenbeek

DUTCH: 1853-1903

_HOLLAND MEADOW--SPRING_

Water Color

_Height, 10½ inches; length, 16½ inches_


From the right foreground a narrow canal, partly choked by a rank
growth of reeds and rushes, crosses diagonally a broad, marshy meadow
in which two spotted cows are lying on the grass and where pollarded
willows grow. In the distance between the trees is a glimpse of a blue
hillside far away, and a few sunlit clouds float in the summer sky.

  _Signed at the lower left_, G. POGGENBEEK.




Nº 13

Josef Israëls

DUTCH: 1824-

_OLD AGE_

Water Color

_Height, 13 inches; width, 10 inches_


An old peasant woman, wearing a white linen cap, an ample cloak with
high collar over her shoulders and around her neck, and a black
petticoat, sits in a low kitchen chair in front of a small fire on the
hearth, warming her extended trembling hands, evidently enjoying the
luxury of the fire.

  _Signed at the lower left_, JOSEF ISRAËLS.




Nº 14

Johannes Hendrik Weissenbruch

DUTCH: 1824-1903

_A HEATH IN HOLLAND_

Water Color

_Height, 11 inches; length, 19 inches_


A great building, roughly thatched, with a door and window in its gable
end, and its ridge irregular and broken, stands in an open waste. Four
slender trees grow near the building, and are the only ones which break
the irregular surface of the great pasture. Three cows are wandering
across the field toward the building, apparently seeking shelter for
the night. A few birds flutter high in the sky above, and the light of
the setting sun is concentrated near the horizon and behind the rude
structure.

  _Signed at the lower left_, J. H. WEISSENBRUCH.




Nº 15

Willem Maris

DUTCH: 1844-

_COWS IN PASTURE_

Water Color

_Height, 14½ inches; length, 21½ inches_


Two cows, one black, spotted with white, and the other dun-colored with
a white face, stand near a pool in the foreground, browsing on the
reeds and coarse grass which grow there. Beyond them the view extends
across the broad open pasture where other cattle are feeding, and
where, in the distance, the familiar forms of windmills rise against
the sky.

  _Signed at the lower left_, WILLEM MARIS.

Albert Neuhuys

DUTCH: 1844-

_AMONG THE FLOWERS_

Water Color

_Height, 28 inches; width, 16½ inches_


A lady (the artist’s wife) in outdoor costume, consisting of a brown
skirt and sleeveless jacket over a black bodice and petticoat, and a
turban-like hat, stands in a conservatory surrounded by chrysanthemums,
plucking some of the delicately colored blossoms. The figure is lighted
from the upper right, and in the background is suggested the glass roof
of the conservatory with a mass of flowering plants.

  _Signed at the lower right_, ALB. NEUHUYS.




Nº 17

Johannes Hendrik Weissenbruch

DUTCH: 1824-1903

_A SUMMER DAY IN HOLLAND_

Water Color

_Height, 21½ inches; width, 13½ inches_


Four spotted cattle, watched by a small boy in a blue blouse, broad
white trousers, black cap and wooden shoes, are resting, partly in
sunlight and partly in shadow, near a sandy road which leads from the
foreground to a lofty straw stack in the distance overhung by tall
trees in heavy foliage. The full summer sun falls upon the landscape,
casting a broken shadow upon the middle distance and illuminating the
great masses of vapor which fill the sky.

  _Signed at the lower right_, J. H. WEISSENBRUCH.

Jacob Maris

DUTCH: 1837-1899

_VIEW OF DORDRECHT_

Water Color

_Height, 17½ inches; length, 22½ inches_


This is a view across a broad canal in the populous Dutch town, showing
a number of bluff-bowed vessels alongside the quay, and beyond are a
number of houses alternating with clumps of trees, dominated by a lofty
church tower. The sky is filled with luminous summer sunlit clouds.

  _Signed at the lower left_, J. MARIS.

Fredericus Jacobus du Chattel

DUTCH: 1856-

_CANAL IN HOLLAND_

Water Color

_Height, 29 inches; width, 19½ inches_


A narrow canal extends in rapidly diminishing perspective from the
foreground to the middle distance, where it is bounded by a meadow.
The low banks of the canal are fringed with water-weeds, and on the
left tall trees grow on either side of a country road. The calm waters,
along which two swallows skim in rapid flight, reflect the luminous
tones of the quiet evening sky, together with the forms of the lofty
trees that grow along the bank.

  _Signed at the lower left_, FRED. J. DU CHATTEL.

_A FISHERWOMAN_

Water Color

_Height, 29½ inches; width, 20½ inches_


The life-sized head and shoulders of an old Dutch fisherwoman, her thin
gray hair straggling out from underneath her neatly ironed white cap
and her hands lying idly in her lap. Her face is in three-quarters view
to the right, strongly lighted from the upper left, and bears a placid
expression, which, however, tells the story of struggle in life.

This is a study of an open grove of large trees, showing two great
rough tree trunks rising out of the picture in the foreground, and
beyond an open rank of other trees, with a glimpse of a pond and
distant hillsides farther away, and a glowing autumn sky.

_Height, 10 inches; length, 15½ inches_


Beyond a quiet expanse of water which extends across the foreground is
seen a broken muddy shore, gently sloping up to a fringe of low bushes,
beyond which an irregular rank of poplar and other trees forms an
irregular horizon line against a sky filled with rolling storm clouds
touched here and there by brilliant sunlight.

_THE FISHING BOAT_

_Height, 13¾ inches; width, 10¾ inches_


In the foreground, drawn up on the beach, is a small roughly
constructed fishing boat with a single mast and lowered sail,
apparently just landed after a good catch of skate, for the small
cockpit is half filled with fish. A large one lies on the sand near the
boat, and beyond, on the shingle-covered shore, stands a fisherwoman
near a pile of fish, holding another large one in her hand. Following
the line of a beach which sweeps away to the extreme distance, broken
only by a single craft left high and dry by the tide, is a row of
steep-roofed thatched cottages, touched here and there by a strong
shaft of sunlight which breaks through the rolling storm clouds
covering the sky.

This is a view across a broad expanse of water, showing in the
foreground a shoal with gently breaking waves in a succession of small
combers, and farther away, beyond narrow sandy banks which show in
luminous lines in the water, is a line of breakers on the edge of the
sea, beyond which the sails of a few fishing vessels gleam in the
sunlight and break the level of the high horizon.

In the near foreground in a flower-grown sward are three fruit trees in
full blossom, their flower-laden branches almost concealing the sky and
extending out of the picture at the top. Beyond the trees, on the far
side of a low wattled fence which is flecked here and there by strong
sunlight, are seen a farm-house and farm buildings among trees in full
foliage.

A broad road, partly overgrown by grass and extending across the
foreground, leads between stone cottages with thatched roofs to an
opening under overhanging trees in the distance. Three cows are walking
along the road in the sunlight, apparently on their way to the pasture
just outside the confines of the village.

In a small square in a large Dutch town the usual market is being held,
and crowds of people are assembled around the booths in the shadow of
the houses in a narrow street, which, on the left, extends away in
perspective past the corner of a large brick church which raises a
lofty cupola above a steep roof against the sky. The sunlight falls
upon the scene from the left, accentuating the façades and gables of
the houses along the street and the front of a small public building
which stands under the very eaves of the church, overhung by a clump of
leafless trees.

A dun-colored cow, spotted with white, is standing in full sunlight
in a broad pasture bounded by a rank of trees in the distance. She is
facing to the right, with her head somewhat lowered and her ears thrown
back, and is in strong effect of full sunlight from the upper right,
the face, fore legs and fore shoulders being in luminous shadow.

Two cows, one red and white and the other dun-colored, are standing
in the sunlight in the corner of a rich pasture which is bordered by
a hedge with a row of slender trees, showing a gate leading into a
field beyond. On the right is the steep roof of a farm building rising
above the surrounding trees, and in the horizon against a sunlit sky is
suggested a second farm-house similarly situated.

_THE FALCONERS_

_Height, 9½ inches; width, 7 inches_


In an open glade in a great park or forest a small party of mounted
falconers have been enjoying their hunt. One of them, who has been
riding a white horse, has dismounted, and is conversing with a friend,
apparently the host of the occasion, who, with a gesture of authority,
is giving directions about the hunt. Beyond the horsemen stands an
attendant in gay livery, carrying three of the hooded birds upon a
perch, and behind the group a clump of trees in dense foliage rises
high against a clouded sky through which the sunlight bursts and falls
strongly upon the landscape.

From a rounded hilltop in the foreground, which is covered with rankly
growing reeds and low bushes, the vista extends across a rolling
country to the horizon, where the level line of the sea meets the
sky. In the distance, on the left, a coppice in autumn foliage covers
the hillside, and on the right the slopes are broken by patches of
cultivated land. A few low, drifting clouds contrast with a high
stratum of cirri, through rifts in which is seen the soft luminous
summer sky.

It is a breezy day at this famous Dutch watering place and fishing
village, and a line of breakers tumbles on the shallow beach and dashes
over the hulls of fishing vessels which, with partly lowered sails, are
awaiting the fall of the tide. In the foreground on the left is a group
of fisher folk, with ladies and gentlemen. Great sunlit cumuli drift
across the sky, which is reflected here and there in the shallow pools
in the sand.

From the left foreground a deep and narrow river leads away, between
grassy banks, to the middle distance, where it is crossed by a stone
bridge with a single arch. Beyond the bridge, which is flanked on the
right by an irregular hedge, and on the left by scattered clumps of
trees and bushes, is a vista across a meadow to a distant village,
dominated by a church with a lofty spire. The sky is covered with a
luminous haze in which sunlit scuds are drifting, and the full light of
a midday summer sun falls upon the landscape.

A rolling tract of rough land extends away to the horizon, where the
sky line is formed by bare hilltops, broken here and there by the
branches of leafless trees which grow along a muddy road winding from
the right foreground around to the left. A cart drawn by a white horse,
accompanied by a peasant, approaches along the road. Large masses of
sunlit vapor nearly cover the blue of the sky.

A few cows are seen in a small open glade in a large forest, two of
them near a large ledge of rock which rises out of the coarse grass on
the top of a slight elevation in the left foreground, and two others
are drinking in a shallow pool under the trees on the right. A rank
of densely growing trees extends across the picture in the middle
distance in strong contrast against the luminous blue of the summer
sky, in which small lazily floating cumuli are strongly touched by the
sunlight, which accentuates the slender trunk of a tree in the middle
of the composition, and glints here and there upon the animals, the
rock and the grass.

In the foreground on the left is a whitewashed roughly thatched
cottage, the gable touched by the sunlight as well as the side of a
lean-to hovel. To the right of the cottage a number of small fruit
trees with gnarled and twisted trunks and branches grow near a straw
stack, and beneath them in the sunlight stands the figure of a peasant
woman who has apparently been hanging her clothes to dry upon a rough
sapling fence. The cottage and the trees are in contrast against a
simple, quiet, but luminous sky. The near foreground and the distance,
in which is suggested a clump of trees, are in full sunlight.

In the foreground, strongly illuminated by full sunshine, three horses
stand near a shallow pool of water, the nearest one white, the other
two gray and brown respectively. On the latter sits a peasant wearing
a blue blouse and holding a whip in his hand. In the distance the open
field is bounded by an irregular hedge of trees of various sorts,
extending nearly to the top of the picture.

A partly draped female figure is seated upon a rock, her head turned
away and resting upon her left hand, the left elbow being supported
upon her right thigh. A black mantle is draped across one knee, and
contrasts strongly with the flesh and a white garment which is spread
upon the rock. In the background is suggested a tree trunk and a mass
of foliage, and the figure is in strong effect of light from the upper
right.

In the foreground three tall elm trees, growing in a stone wall, rise
out of the picture, and beyond them, across an enclosed sunlit meadow
where a few cows are feeding, is seen on the left the whitewashed gable
of a farmhouse, which is almost entirely concealed by lofty rounded
trees in rich summer foliage, and which, in strong effect of light and
shade, rise high against a cloudy sky. Through an opening in the rank
of great trees, which extends across the middle distance, is a vista to
a distant horizon across a pleasant wooded country.

In the left foreground a well-worn country road leads along the crest
of a hill in rapidly diminishing perspective to the middle distance,
where it disappears among the trees, and apparently descends into a
wooded vale at the foot of the hill. Beyond the vale on the right is a
broad broken hillside, with here and there trees and cultivated fields,
and from the summit of one of the elevations a wreath of white smoke
drifts away. The sky is covered with luminous gray clouds, the sunlight
struggling to break through here and there, and a few spots of blue
show half way to the zenith.

A broad level pasture, in which a few black and white cattle are
feeding, extends from the foreground to the distance, where the horizon
line is formed by an irregular row of trees, broken by a windmill and
the roofs of farm buildings. From the right foreground a narrow canal
runs under a foot bridge, and, reflecting the strong sunlight from the
sky, breaks the green expanse of the meadow in a diagonal line to the
left. Through rifts in the low floating clouds a warm summer sunlight
bursts forth and floods the landscape.

inclined, and the eyes turned toward the spectator. Her wavy hair,
tinged with auburn, is brushed back from her forehead and tied in a
small knot at the top. Her left arm is bare and her hand held to her
bosom, and the flesh is in contrast against a short-sleeved black
velvet bodice, trimmed with lace, which falls over the upper arm. The
background is a graded tone of gray green.

In a rustic interior in Holland a peasant girl is seated, holding
in her lap a pewter porringer, resting her right elbow on a barrel.
Beside her sits her peasant lover, playing some prank at which both are
heartily laughing. In the gloom of the interior in the background are
seen a hooded chimney-place with a fire on the hearth, and a curtained
bed. A square-shouldered gin bottle and a thick pancake stand on the
head of the barrel beside the girl, and various articles of domestic
use are hung in the fireplace and on the walls.

A shallow pool in which grow rushes and water weeds extends across the
foreground to the middle distance, where it is bounded by the low,
broken bank of a meadow, against which are clumps of tall reeds and
where a skiff, with a single figure in a blue blouse, is moored to a
stake. Beyond the meadow on the left rises a sand hill, crowned with
poplars and other trees, and on the right is the corner of a large wood
growing on a grass covered slope, with here and there patches of sand
and outcropping ledges. The sky is covered with a mass of luminous
vapor.

The motive for this picture was found in the broad pasture meadows of
Holland, where narrow canals run through the land, and here and there
trees break the monotony of the surface and the grass is dotted with
feeding cattle. A narrow ditch, partly filled with growing rushes,
reflects, in the foreground, the light of the sky, and near it, on the
right, a few black and white Dutch cows are lying on the grass. Beyond,
in the middle distance, the gleam of water shows the line of a canal,
and on the right a lofty tree, dominating a row of pollarded willows,
rises high against the sky, which is filled with quietly drifting
cumuli.

narrow path in a broken park-like country, where open glades alternate
with huge trees in heavy foliage. On the right great beeches rise out
of the picture and are in contrast against a quiet, cloudy summer sky.
The foreground is in modified shadow, and the sunlight falls upon
the middle distance, glinting on the silvery stems of the trees and
accentuating the broad masses of the foliage and the grass.

A storm has just swept over a level tract of land, broken here and
there by trees and bushes, and the sun, already near the horizon, is
sending through the clouds a vivid gleam of light. In the foreground
a narrow, irregular pool of water reflects the concentrated sunlight,
and near it a single tree, with slender stem and dense rounded foliage,
forms a strong contrast, accentuating the focus of the composition.

two sturdy old trees, one of them with lopped branches, the other
with a tall columnar trunk, rising out of the picture. In the shadow,
underneath the nearer tree, is seated a young lady reading a book and
evidently enjoying the cool shade. Beyond, in the middle distance, is a
succession of cultivated fields divided by hedges, with a single farm
building, and here and there isolated trees. A range of low wooded
hills forms the horizon line against a simple luminous sky.

is bounded by a grassy slope partly covered by low trees. On the left
rises a steep bank, crowned by a rank of poplars and lilies, and water
weeds and rushes grow in profusion along the shore. A skiff with two
occupants floats near the point of the bank, where a fisherman stands
apparently waiting to enter the boat. Beyond, the view extends over a
wooded country to a distant hillside which forms the horizon, and the
lofty sky is covered with a thin veil of luminous mist with scattered
low-drifting clouds.

The sun has disappeared below the horizon and the sky is glowing with
ruddy, reflected light, touching the edges of the high-floating clouds
and sending a warm glow over the landscape. The motive was found in a
flat country, where the horizon is almost as level as the sea, and the
irregular ground is broken here and there by rocks, bushes and small
pools of water, and by sparsely growing trees. In the left foreground,
near a stunted oak tree which grows alongside a muddy road, are dimly
suggested in the gloom of twilight figures of peasants with horses and
a cart, and on the right a small pool of water reflects the glow of the
sky.

with a mass of gray clouds, through which a shaft of sunlight breaks
well up toward the zenith.

bound the river, are rows of stakes and poles, suggesting their use
as fishing traps. On the left, rising above a thickly growing mass of
reeds and rushes, stands a sturdy oak tree, its rounded top rising

A number of large fishing boats have been left on the sandy beach by
the receding tide, and the fisher folk are busy unloading one of them
into a one-horse cart which has been backed up to her side. Three
fisherwomen are seated on the beach near by, and another one, with a
small child, stands near the edge of the water alongside the horse,
which patiently awaits his load. A few sunlit clouds drift high in the
sky and the shimmering expanse of water is flooded by sunlight, the
horizon line being nearly lost in the warm glow. In the foreground
shallow pools of water in the sand reflect the sky and the masts and
hulls of the boats.

boat as it approaches the landing. The sky is covered with drifting
masses of gray clouds, the light on which is concentrated near the
horizon on the right, where the towers and roofs of the town are in
silhouette against it.

_A MARKET SCENE IN VENICE_

_Height, 30½ inches; length, 41 inches_


This is a study of a characteristic shop in a Venetian street where
eatables of every kind are sold. On the left stands on a scaldino a
steaming kettle, and near it salt codfish are displayed. Under a rough
wooden awning stand barrels full of herring, a suspended chicken, boxes
of oranges and other fruit, and standing near the fruit is a young
girl, apparently examining the wares or bargaining with the grocery man.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.”

• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
  works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you “AS-IS”, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
